Methodology Details

Our application utilizes a combination of reliable data sources and sophisticated algorithms to fetch publication information:

    ORCID Integration: By entering your ORCID ID, the app queries the ORCID API to retrieve a list of publications associated with your account.
    Crossref and Altmetric: For each publication, we further enrich the data by fetching metadata from Crossref and altmetrics from Altmetric.com. This provides comprehensive details about each publication, including titles, authors, journal information, and more.
    Data Accuracy and Privacy: We prioritize the accuracy of the data fetched and the privacy of our users. No personal information is stored or used beyond the scope of publication fetching.
